                <h1>OUR RESEARCH JOURNEY</h1>
                <p>To accomplish our task, our team implemented AI called a convolutional neural network. Convolution is very good at outlining <br> or getting the edges of the object in an image. Our AI essentially uses convolution to reduce the information to the most important parts and classifies objects in <br> the image into 8 categories: plastic, glass, paper, organic, metal, e-waste, and just trash.</p>

                    <p>We developed a beginner model in Tensorflow that has 78% accuracy. It had 1 sequential layer with 3 inner layers.

                    <p>We switched to Pytorch since Tensorflow did not allow us to use graphics (GPU). With new members in our team, we began to implement keyword API, build a webpage, and expand on object detection. Our model has progressed to have 80% accuracy.
