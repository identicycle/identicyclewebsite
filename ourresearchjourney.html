                <h1>OUR RESEARCH JOURNEY</h1>
                <p>To accomplish our task, our team implemented AI called a convolutional neural network. Convolution is very good at outlining <br> or getting the edges of the object in an image. Our AI essentially uses convolution to reduce the information to the most important parts and classifies objects in <br> the image into 7 categories: plastic, glass, paper, organic, metal, e-waste, and just trash.</p>

                    <p>We developed a beginner model in Tensorflow that has 78% accuracy. It had 1 sequential layer with 3 inner layers.

                    <p>We switched to Pytorch since Tensorflow did not allow us to use graphics (GPU). With new members in our team, we began to implement keyword API, build a webpage, and expand on object detection. Our model has progressed to have 80% accuracy.

                    <p>We constructed a database and established algorithms for API. This filters the algorithm in order to find the best category match. We also added the finishing touches to our AI model and prepared our website for deployment. Our model now has 95% accuracy.
